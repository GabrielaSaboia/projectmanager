IS322 Project #2
–
React Applications
In this assignment you will be tasked with creating a simple project management application
with an extremely basic set of features. A board view where you can view all of your tasks in
columns relating to their status, a list view to view and filter all t
asks at once, and an add form
to be able to add new tasks to your project. The board view is required for all groups, two
person groups can then pick from the list or add form, three person groups must do all three
pages.
The instructions below give gene
ral requirements for each of the components and pages you’ll
be expected to create. These are the minimum required, anything beyond that will be awarded
extra credit. Videos will be posted in moodle to help explain some of the concepts behind
various requi
rements. Most requirements will reference a specific video who can watch to get
more information on.
This assignment should be written in React and JSX, using create
-
react
-
app as a basis for the
application (see
Setting up React
Video in Moodle). The project will contect to a mock API to
pull data from, you can use mine or create your own (see
JSON Server Tutorial
video in moodle).
You do not need a full back
-
end server for this assignment.
General Requirements
